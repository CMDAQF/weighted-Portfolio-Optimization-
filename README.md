# weighted-Portfolio-Optimization-

This program gives you insight on how your portfolio preformed against several benchmarks of your choosing, aswell as optimized portfolios over a given time. Through the portfolio optimization you can see if your allocation could have preformed better, if changes to the portfolio contributed to the return, and if allocation adjustment made to portfolio when anticipating certain market events or trends were succesful.

This program takes 3 dictionaries a current portfolio with current symbols and weights and a "fund_allocation" with symbols and weight ranges to generate within. Furthermore it takes a dictionary called asset_class which provide weights for certian asset classes in "funds_allocation" inorder to constrain the portfolio optimization.  
You can adjust time, benchmarks, and number of generations.
